## TinaCMS is an Open-Source CMS powered by GIT and made for the JAMStack

Tina CMS is a relatively young open source project (est. 2019) and is maintained by [forestry](https://forestry.io). Forestry already offers services with a headless CMS of the same name and has now remarkably decided to improve on that and work in the open with Tina to create a CMS for the JAMStack.

There are libraries available for ReactJS in general and specially for integrating with Gatsby and NextJS. You can decide to manage your content via Plugins for either local GIT or GitHub, the latter providing a nice way for [Open Authoring](https://tinacms.org/guides/nextjs/github/initial-setup/).

## Open Authoring and how does it work

In general Open Authoring means that you invite visitors on your site to edit your content. **Be collaborative!**
You can see that on a lot of sites that redirect you to the GitHub website of the base repository.

However that is a suboptimal experience, because you have to work with the raw text and without context. The solution that is provided by Tina is much better, because you can edit with a live preview and in the context of the presentation.

In order to make it work, the visitor to your site just needs an account with GitHub and can edit the page, create a Pull Request and thus you can moderate what changes should be introduced into your content.
