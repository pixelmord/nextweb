## What is Throttle and Debounce?

Both are concepts to limit the number of times a function is called. Typically that is useful for event handlers that get called very often.
Think of mouse movement, keyboard or window resize events in human interaction or data streams in automation or device events.

## Why should you know and care about those functions/concepts?

Because your programm does not always care about all these events or even more importantly that the user experience can be significantly improved by not reacting to every event.
You might not care about all the data during a resize event, because reacting to it every frame would lead to potential performance issues when you would redraw the layout hundreds of times.
For a user it might be confusing that for example during an autocomplete in a searchbox for every keystroke there would be new or no results to some fragments of words that might makle no sense.
Or it would be just visually distracting if new results come "flickering" in for every keystroke. While reading data from a device's output stream, you might for example only be interested in it every X seconds and not the more frequent updates that the device sends.

## Ok, so what is the difference?

A throttled function is executed only EVERY X milliseconds with the last value given. (Imagine a door that only opens in an interval)
A debounced function is executed only after a value has not been given for X milliseconds. (Imagine a door that only opens if nobody has been knocking anymore for a while)

### Here is a codepen in react with throttle and debounce hooks to try it out:

### Use cases for Throttle

Examples would be scenarios where you care about constant updates, but for performance or experience reasons you want to set your own interval time.
Users might not care about a stock update every millisecond, but every 10 seconds might be "real-time" enough.
