This is the story behind this blog and how I did set it up. First of all I noticed over the years of not really writing that one of the reasons for that was that I did not have a topic dear to my heart that would merit writing about.
So in order to fix that I sat down and thought hard about what could be the overarching theme for content creation. As an architect and maker there's one thing that I do every day, which is look what is happening in the web development ecosphere for great tools, libraries and projects that I can use for building and _avoid implementing myself_.
I am always curious what others are building, which new ideas arise and how I could improve my workflow and build projects faster while improving quality at the same time.
