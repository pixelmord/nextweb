I am currently working on a couple of projects. Too many actually, but the thing is, I keep having ideas all the time. 💥

The topic dear to my heart are around productivity, managing knowledge and how to upgrade existing ideas with exeptional UX.
The holy grail of the human centered and **intuitive** UI.
I like to upgrade existing tools and integrate with well established services to create a new twist on how to use them.

## Poolbase Planner

The planner acts as a frontend for planning work tasks that

- require to be prioritized according to urgency and importance,
- have acceptance criteria and possibly subtasks
- have relationships with other tasks
- need to be estimated in terms of effort
- are time tracked
- need to be planned alongside other chores and meetings

The planner integrates with established tools like Jira and Github Projects and can be used seamlessly in conjunction with them.
