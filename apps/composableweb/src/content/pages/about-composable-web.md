summary: 'The biggest advantage of using web-technology for building applications is the ability to deliver incremental results fast. That fits right into an agile mindset, where short cycles of development lead from idea to prototype to usable software that can be incrementally shipped. Those ideas work best with component thinking, not only in terms of front-end components, but also in composition of webservices and APIs.'

Over the last years thinking in components, microservices and microfrontends has taken over our mindsets that previously saw application building more from a monolithic perspective. Generally composing applications from library packages, UI components, APIs and SAAS is now a best practice. However, like every solution for web software architecture there are drawbacks that come together with the obvious benefits.

As a software architect I have to weigh the more or less obvious upsides against the sometimes not so obvious downsides and create solutions that are sustainable, maintainable, humane, performant and offer great user experience. With my personal background and work history, I judge things regarding innovation and creativity as well as if they're 'enterprise ready'.

## What does that even mean, "Composable Web"?

In a broader sense the web has evolved from a collection of hyperlinked documents to what we we now perceive as a giant database of information, a social network and an application platform. Building Websites and Applications for the web nowadays has many commonalities, often it is the same thing, because most content is not static anymore and not all content is text, people expect to not only consume content but to interact with it. So already from a user's point of view the services are not monolithic anymore and even more so from a service provider's standpoint it it makes sense to build a composed architecture.

On the Webworker level (from conception, planning and design to development and back) the concept of composition has a long standing tradition

- for planning in sprints, tickets, epics, stories, tasks, chores
- for concepts in storyboards, user flows, personas
- for design in style guides, symbols, artifacts, design systems
- for code in packages, libraries, modules, extensions, components etc.

### Composition impacts Planning, Craftsmanship, Creativity

So if composition makes sense, so how does that impact craftsmanship and creativity when the notion is to not plan, design and build everything yourself (in-house, in your team, in your company)? Planning must account for external release cycles and involve planning of contributions to the components that are used. Part of craftsmanship must become the expertise in selecting the right components and crafting the APIs that bring them to work together. The creative process needs to account for the concepts used in third-party building blocks and flourish in the refinement of those concepts and maintain an own identity at the same time.
For the architect and developer that means that he must know the ecosystem very well and also be able to judge the maturity and the health of used components and services.
