## Be honest, work hard and help others

That is a sentence that packs a lot into it. 

Regarding honesty, I do not see that only as a means to treat others well, but that is also very important to my personal wellbeing, because lying is hard and and always finds a way of coming back to you. I just feel much better to communicate things straight even if that in some cases might lead to conflict at start, but in the long run relationships in business as well as personal life have just a better foundation.
Working hard does not stand for stress and the shear amount of things that can be delivered, for me that is about intensity and striving for perfection, about doing things right by putting in the effort needed to achieve the best possible result.
Helping others is very important, not because of Karma (alone), but because of the interesting input and learnings you get by concerning yourself with the problems and desires of others. There's just a lot to learn and the bonus is that in the end if you do things right you get showered by greatfulness.

## Creativity: Ideas are mighty instruments

Creativity can show up in a lot of places, it is not solely about being an artist. Creativity for me stands as well for finding creative solutions and thinking outside of the box that things might be locked into. Taking some unrelated parts or tools and making something new by combination, subtraction or repurposing. In that sense I see Makers, Tinkerers and Hackers as highly creative people and sometimes the beauty comes in the disguise of something that just works well or in mysterious ways.
