OS matters for a couple of very different reasons depending on who you ask.
Developers like the fact that they do not need to reinvent the wheel, do not need to maintain all libraries that they use and on the other hand find a great community to collaborate with likeminded people.
Businesses profit from Open-Source because the money that they spend goes into customization and building great products and not into licence fees for ready made solutions that only almost do what's needed with the price of being locked-in with the vendor.
End-Users might not always know of the fact that the service or app they are using is built with OS software, but they might notice the difference, because software that is built by people that do care more of the why and how also care more about inclusiveness and accessability which ultimately shows in usability.

## Delivering value for your core vision

As an organization wanting to build a product or service you need to reflect upon how you use your money wisely. If you plan on using proprietary "full-service" solutions you might end up paying for parts that you have no use of and others that are maybe only useful in part for what you want to achieve. So to address this you have to build yourself or hire someone to do this for you and most of all you need to invest most of your money into everything that entails the use-case you are building for. Using Open Source Software brings you almost all the parts you need for building great a great application. Developing Open Source Software as an organization or individual brings you contributions, security and improvements for free.

### Avoid vendor lock-in

While not paying money might be one of the first thoughts that come to mind of a startup or grown business alike, that might be countered by the fact that you have to invest in building the solutions yourself even if the parts come for free. There might be an even bigger win with avoiding the vendor lock-in. Being locked-in means not being able to choose integrations, being restricted in customization, having to wait for features even if they are planned and ultimately being bound to the vision and success or lack thereof of a third party.

### Put your money where your mind is

You might have to put some effort into integrating various libraries and building blocks by writing integrational code "glue code", but you get the benefit of ready made solutions for e.g. authentication, database access, form handling and rapidly building a UI with components to name only a few.

The rest of your efforts in implementation can fully go into your business logic and the core of what you want to offer to your customers or audience.

## Benefits of working in the open

### Transparency

### Accountability

### Collaboration with the users of the software

### Security

## Great Examples of Open-Source Projects
